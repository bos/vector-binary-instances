-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Instances of Data.Binary and Data.Serialize for vector

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:
   Instances for Binary for the types defined in the vector package,
   making it easy to serialize vectors to and from disk. We use the
   generic interface to vectors, so all vector types are supported.
   Specific instances are provided for unboxed, boxed and storable
   vectors.
   .
   To serialize a vector:
   .
   > *Data.Vector.Binary> let v = Data.Vector.fromList [1..10]
   > *Data.Vector.Binary> v
   > fromList [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] :: Data.Vector.Vector
   > *Data.Vector.Binary> encode v
   > Chunk "\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL...\NUL\NUL\NUL\t\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\n" Empty
   .
   Which you can in turn compress before writing to disk:
   .
   > compress . encode $ v
   > Chunk "\US\139\b\NUL\NUL\N...\229\240,\254:\NUL\NUL\NUL" Empty
